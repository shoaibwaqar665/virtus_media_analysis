    "description": "Good morning everyone. Yesterday was disastrous as almost the entire stock market was down on the day - it'll be tough to hold optimism through the week on this watchlist, but here's some of the stocks I'll have my eye on as we coast through the week.\n\n**Actuate Therapeutics, Inc. ($ACTU) – $6.82**\n\nActuate is a clinical-stage oncology company focused on targeting the GSK3β pathway, an emerging mechanism linked to drug resistance and tumor progression. Their lead candidate, elraglusib, is currently in Phase II trials for glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer—two of the toughest-to-treat forms of cancer in the field. What separates Actuate is their growing interest from institutions and early signs of activity within the orphan drug and rare disease spaces.   \n  \nThe biotech's therapeutic strategy is tightly focused but addresses areas of high unmet medical need, which could be an edge when it comes to gaining regulatory traction. They’ve also been making steady progress with collaborative studies and grant-funded research, signaling continued institutional support. If those trials show further efficacy later this year, it could catalyze new partnership or licensing opportunities.\n\n**Nuvve Holding Corp. ($NVVE) – $0.8801**\n\nNuvve is quietly working in the background of the energy sector, building out its intelligent energy platform for EV fleets and grid integration. Their V2G (vehicle-to-grid) tech is finally gaining traction with new pilot projects in school districts and municipalities, and potentially for long-term use.   \n  \nWith U.S. infrastructure policy starting to prioritize grid flexibility, $NVVE could be better positioned than most give credit for. Financials still show weakness, but their recent investor update hinted at tightening costs and more focused execution. The stock has also bounced off $2.75 multiple times now, suggesting a potential bottom might be forming.\n\n**Wipro Ltd. ($WIT) – $2.85**\n\nWipro Ltd. has leaned into its digital transformation offerings, expanding enterprise solutions across cloud, cybersecurity, and AI—a trio of high-demand verticals with broad industry tailwinds. Their recent acquisitions in Europe and the Middle East have added depth to their delivery capabilities, especially in areas like predictive analytics and IT automation. In the last earnings call,   \n  \n$WIT's leadership highlighted rising demand for consulting projects tied to generative AI deployments across healthcare and banking clients. Revenue has remained steady, and the company continues to return capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, signaling long-term confidence. With a strong presence in over 60 countries and over 250,000 employees globally The company's scale gives it insulation from localized slowdowns and adds optionality in future bidding cycles.\n\nStay safe out there this week.\n\nCommunicated Disclaimer - DYOR \n\nSources [1](https://actuatetherapeutics.com/) [2](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ACTU) [3](https://nuvve.com/) [4](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVVE) [5](https://www.wipro.com/) [6](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WIT) [7](https://chartingdaily.com/Actu) [8](https://chartingdaily.com/intelligently-electrifying-the-planet)",
