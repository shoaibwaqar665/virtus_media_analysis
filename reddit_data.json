        "description": "It's not like I don't often research small-cap companies in unique spaces of the U.S. stock market, but this one takes a turn to an industry I've never took my time to research. At first I thought that there wasn't much to find in the beverage industry, but some broader market research has me interested in this latest find.\n\nSafety Shot, Inc. (NASDAQ: $SHOT) is a wellness and functional beverage company that specializes in developing over-the-counter products and intellectual property aimed at enhancing health and well-being. Their flagship product, Sure Shot, is marketed as the world's first patented beverage clinically proven to rapidly reduce BAC (blood alcohol content).\n\nSafety Shot's Sure Shot is designed to address the growing consumer demand for effective alcohol recovery solutions. The beverage leverages scientifically backed ingredients intended to enhance alcohol metabolism and promote mental clarity. Unlike traditional recovery drinks that may take hours to show results, Sure Shot is formulated to work within 30 minutes, offering a rapid and effective method for consumers to regain control after alcohol consumption.\n\nSafety Shot has made a strong effort as of late\n\n* **Product Line Expansion:** The company launched on-the-go stick packs of Sure Shot, aiming to disrupt the $2 billion wellness market by offering consumers a convenient and portable option for alcohol recovery. ​\n* **Acquisitions:** Safety Shot recently acquired Yerbae, a popular plant-based energy beverage company along with their $12 million in revenue and experienced leadership. ​\n* **Financial Strategy:** The company terminated its at-the-market equity offering program, reaffirming its commitment to shareholder value and indicating a strategic shift in its capital-raising approach. ​\n\nThe global hangover remedy market is valued at approximately $1.5 billion and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.6% through 2028. By offering a scientifically validated solution that not only reduces BAC but also enhances mental clarity and energy levels, the company addresses a seemingly unmet need in the functional beverage industry for recovery drinks.\n\n$SHOT's Sure Shot product is something I haven't seen in a unique market that I think has the potential for growth. Safety Shot's recent efforts to to capitalize on the growing demand for effective alcohol recovery solutions also make this one to keep an eye on. I'm planning on reporting more on the broader market soon and why I think this find is different.\n\nCommunicated Disclaimer - DYOR\n\nSources [1](https://safetyshotofficial.com/) [2](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHOT/) [3](https://stockresearchtoday.com/redefining-the-functional-beverage-industry/)",

        "description": "Alright, the next part of my due diligence.\n\nHave you ever wondered which sector has seen the biggest surge in growth in the 21st century? Or even which stock? Of course, I made the assumption of big-tech, but when you look at the given time period, I was wrong....\n\nThere's a bunch of innovative subsectors filled with names that have boomed over the last 25 years - $NVDA has grown 1,117x since the year 2000, $AAPL 237x, Amazon 44x, but none of those lead in share price growth... \n\nInstead, its Monster Energy's stock, which has grown 1,371x since 2000.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvk9m4586ype1.png?width=1574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be16903ee983ca8cd02e5b949afad0efa09807e2\n\nBut of course it's not $MNST that I have my eye on - after all, we're all small-cap enthusiasts in here. The reason I'm amazed by this note is because it's simply because Monster Energy was able to introduce the right beverage product to the right audience at the right time... just like I think $SHOT is doing...\n\nSafety Shot's Sure Shot product is the first of it's kind. There's never been a hangover remedy drink, mix-in, etc. that's served the sole purpose of curing your hangover along with giving the hung-over the boost they need to go about that day.   \n  \nSure Shot is also a zero-sugar, low-calorie product in a world that's moving away from and recognizing the terrible side effects of sugar consumption. $SHOT's influencer endorsements with the Nelk Boys, Matthew Espinosa, and Danny Way can also give this small company the audience it deserves. On top of buying out Yerbae recently (who I see all over gas station shelves), I've moved from cautiously optimistic about this find to actually quite excited...\n\nBeyond $MNST seeing the growth they have over the last 25 years, companies like $CELH have seen similar within the exact same sector. Right product, right time. Maybe it's because there's plenty of alcoholism in my neck of the woods, but I think Sure shot could be the next 'right product.'\n\nCommunicated Disclaimer - DYOR \n\nSources [1](https://safetyshotofficial.com/) [2](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHOT/) [3](https://stockresearchtoday.com/redefining-the-functional-beverage-industry/)",

        "title": "Hear me out... there's some recent catalysts on my latest stock to watch",
        "description": "Happy Hump Day fellas. Last week I posted some of my findings in my recent pick to click in the company that is Safety Shot $SHOT, and while there was mixed sentiment in opposition to my own, I've come here today to discuss some of the recent catalysts $SHOT has had over the last 5-7 days.\n\nFor starters, $SHOT reported a February 2025 revenue total of $580,000, more than twice what it generated in January, marking their highest monthly total to date since launching in retail and was driven by increasing demand from convenience stores, liquor retailers, and online platforms. For a newer brand in the functional beverage space, this kind of month-over-month traction is worth paying attention to.\n\nIn a separate shareholder communication, CEO of $SHOT Brian John outlined plans for broadening distribution and building brand awareness.   \n  \nThe company has partnered with Breakthru Beverage, a major alcohol distributor in North America, and launched national ad campaigns to support rollout efforts. $SHOT appears focused on long-term positioning and education around their hangover remedy drink product.\n\nZooming out, $SHOT appears to be attempting to enter a growth phase, with some early indicators of traction and retail scale beginning to take shape. There’s still a lot to prove, yes, but investors watching this name will likely be tracking ongoing sales numbers, new distribution announcements, and any forward-looking commentary around potential licensing or geographic expansion as the story develops. I think it'll be worth keeping an eye on how execution plays out.\n\nCommunicated Disclaimer - DYOR \n\nSources  \n[1](https://safetyshotofficial.com/) [2](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHOT/) [3](https://stockresearchtoday.com/redefining-the-functional-beverage-industry/)",

        "title": "After a fundamental breakdown yesterday, here's how the chart is shaping out",
        "description": "Good morning everyone, after that fundamental outlook yesterday on my recent pick to click in Safety Shot, Inc. ($SHOT), we got ourselves a decent move in the chart, so I came back today to do a breakdown of the 1D chart as we head into Thursday's trading session.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aufsqol52kse1.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4adc3d128708af2f8227b4adee0d03e152da15cc\n\nFollowing its most recent bottom near $0.35, the stock has quietly put in a short-term higher low and is now trading just above the VWAP Session level of $0.4355, with volume ticking up to 574K on the day.\n\nThe chart has seen some compression lately. For several trading sessions, $SHOT hovered in a tight range, which could be signaling accumulation. That sideways consolidation appears to have resolved to the upside today with a move on solid volume -- enough to merit my attention given the broader structure.\n\nThere’s still a fair amount of overhead supply, with the next meaningful price memory area around $0.50–$0.52, and heavier resistance at $0.60+. Any move into that zone would need strong volume continuation and probably a catalyst. But if price can hold AND build above $0.45, we might see some momentum-driven players start nibbling again. EMA 200 remains a distant level ($0.78), so this is still well within a bearish macro structure—but short-term setups like this one can create opportunity on the right tape.\n\nI'll be watching today and tomorrow to see if we can break and hold $0.50\n\nCommunicated Disclaimer - DYOR\n\nSources\n\n[1](https://safetyshotofficial.com/) [2](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHOT/) [3](https://stockresearchtoday.com/redefining-the-functional-beverage-industry/)",

        "title": "Weekly Watchlist: $SHOT Heating Up While $PROP Bleeds — Opportunity in Both?",
        "description": "Good Morning Everyone! It's the second week of April and summer is just around the corner! Kicking off the week watching two very different stories: one showing strength, the other... not so much (down 30%). But sometimes, that’s where the opportunity lies. \n\n**$SHOT – Back On the Radar**\n\nSHOT has been gaining serious momentum lately. After a long pullback, the stock is now back above its 50-day SMA with volume picking up noticeably. That kind of price-action + volume combo usually means buyers are stepping in again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jkxu1a1wete1.png?width=1611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecb498a73eb152a1e8d830f02eb5ac1c4a6f778c\n\nNow all eyes are on the 100 and 200-day moving averages — if SHOT can push through those levels, we could see a continuation into the rest of 2025. The chart’s setting up well, especially considering how much attention it had during its influencer-heavy run last year.\n\n**$PROP – Down, But Not Necessarily Out**\n\nPROP, on the other hand, took a 30% hit last week, largely driven by renewed fears around tariffs and Trump’s trade retaliation plans. Energy names with U.S. operations are getting dragged into the noise.\n\nBut here’s the thing: sometimes the best entries come when sentiment is at its worst. I’m not going full Buffett quote mode here, but he did say something like “buy when there’s blood in the streets,” right??\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz06r5wswete1.png?width=1611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc121a96c06f8a83c098ff08a595dd07c27d0c03\n\nThe fundamentals for PROP haven’t changed — they’ve still got prime acreage and solid production. It’s just getting caught up in the broader mess. If you’ve been waiting to get in, this dip might be the chance.

        "title": "Markets Pop on Surprise Pause – Here’s What I’m Watching: $SHOT &amp; $PROP",
        "description": "Yesterday’s move caught a lot of people off guard. Trump’s unexpected 90-day pause on the new tariffs flipped sentiment almost instantly — and the market responded with strength across the board. After weeks of choppiness and fear-driven selling, we finally got a breather.\n\nNow the question is: was that the relief small caps needed to get moving again?\n\nTwo names I’ve been on top of — $SHOT and $PROP — are already starting to show promising signs.\n\n**$SHOT – Reversal Taking Shape (Up 23% in April)**\n\nSince I first flagged this one, $SHOT has now cleared both its 50 and 100-day SMAs, and it's doing so with steady volume. That’s not something you see every day in this market — especially with no flashy PR or news drops.Outside of the recent earnings report and a brief statement from the CEO, the company’s been relatively quiet — but the chart says otherwise.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3yb7zfjtd0ue1.png?width=1611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63852402ced349013c15b9383f4650d3c9c091a4\n\nNow all eyes are on the 200-day SMA. If SHOT breaks that, we could be looking at a full-on trend reversal playing out in real time.\n\n**$PROP – Bouncing Back With Volume**\n\n$PROP hit a low of $3.80 earlier this week, but the price action since then has flipped the tone. This morning it’s back above $4.50 and trading over the 50-day SMA pre-market.Volume has also picked up noticeably — that’s a sign of renewed interest, not just a dead cat bounce.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohbbj03qd0ue1.png?width=1611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0082ea629226015f6ab39c5e8bc2869357ea358e\n\nStill choppy, but this kind of rebound, paired with broader macro relief, could give it a shot at reclaiming higher levels going into next week. Small caps needed a catalyst — and Trump may have handed them one (whether he meant to or not). Communicated Disclaimer this is not financial advice so make sure to continue your due diligence - Sources [1](https://safetyshotofficial.com/), [2](https://www.prairieopco.com/), [3](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PROP/), [4](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHOT/), [5](https://chartingdaily.com/redefining-the-functional-beverage-industry), [6](https://chartingdaily.com/a-rare-small-cap-growth-play-in-the-u-s-energy-space)",
