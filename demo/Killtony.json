The guy has grinded for years and years to be in the position he’s in and it makes so much sense that he’s strengthened that impulse muscle to peak performance. \n\nNow he’s just pretty much ALWAYS on fire because he lives the lifestyle of an uncancellable comedian. \n\nI like to think of myself as quick witted, but I have a normal day job and a family, so most of the time I cannot act on impulse and say the outlandish shit that comes to my mind because it would be deemed inappropriate to the normal every day person. \n\nTony is surrounded by comedians 24/7 and his literal job is to say crazy shit and roast anyone and everyone. So his response time is fast as FUCK because he’s always in the position to say whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and doesn’t have to worry about offending people, etc. That’s why he’s always on the ball. \n\nIt’s pretty fucking sweet if you ask me. All his hard work has paid off!!!\n\nAnyways, thought that was an interesting anecdote and figured I’d share. 🫡",

I also understand that it's difficult to write a new one minute set every week and that he probably wants to save his best material for his tour. \n\nSeeing him live doing a full length set really changed my perspective. My face hurt from laughing for an hour straight.  For only four years into comedy, this guy can seriously run the room. It was an amazing show and special shout out to his closing bit, which was absolutely hilarious and perfectly executed.\n\nDavid Jolly also opened for him and he was super funny, but it seemed to be a bunch of his Kill Tony one minute sets stringed together.\n\nGo see Kam live if you get the chance. \n",
