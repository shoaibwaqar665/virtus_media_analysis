EVEN WILLIAMS SONG (crazy-gnarles barkley) OR DAVID LUCAS' SONG (bad boy 4 life - Sean \"the diddler\" coombs) ISNT NECESSARILY HIS.THIS IS HANS KIM. ONE OF THE ONLY CONSISTANT TRADITIONS IN KILL TONY, AND YET SOMEHOW, THE BAND MANAGED TO FUCK THAT UP!!!!!!!! \n\nOk, now that that is off my chest, I appreciated you all for listening. The band of course, is amazing, but it just had to be said, they really bungled that one for me.\n",
